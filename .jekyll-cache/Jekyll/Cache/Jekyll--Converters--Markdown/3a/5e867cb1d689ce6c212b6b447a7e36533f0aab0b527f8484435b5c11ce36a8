I"Ý<p>In a <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-leave-the-la-times-poll-alone/">shocking</a> turn of events, Donald Trump won the 2016 U.S. presidential election. After the shock (and distress) subsided, some (myself included) were left wondering if this twist ending was the work of hackers manipulating electronic voting machines. It is certainly possible to <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2011/09/30/researchers-hack-voting-machine-for-26.html">hack e-voting machines</a>. And there is evidence that a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia">state actor</a> did engage in an effort to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/us/politics/us-formally-accuses-russia-of-stealing-dnc-emails.html">manipulate the U.S. election</a>. Putting the two together, some experts have advised the Clinton campaign that votes cast on e-voting machines should be audited for the possibility that these machines were <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/11/activists-urge-hillary-clinton-to-challenge-election-results.html">compromised by foreign agents</a>. These experts claim to have found evidence that Trump performed disproportionately well in certain counties where electronic voting machines were used. <a href="https://www.fivethirtyeight.com">Nate Silver of 538</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/801221546685661184">disagrees</a>. In this article, I provide the data and code necessary to test this hypothesis and to potentially uncover evidence of manipulated, hacked, or otherwise unfair e-voting machines. While I find no evidence that e-voting machines were biased in favor of either candidate, I encourage others to build on this analysis and verify (or contradict) these results.</p>
