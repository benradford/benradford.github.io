I"~<p>So, somehow you managed to find a lot of data for which you want to fit a linear model. The problem is that there are several different categories in the data and you forgot to record which \(x\) falls into which category. Oops. This is especially bad because the relationship between your dependent and independent variables changes across categories. How do we solve this?</p>
