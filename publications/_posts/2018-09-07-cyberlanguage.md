As the amount of cyber data continues to grow, cyber network defenders are faced with increasing amounts of data they must analyze to ensure the security of their networks. In addition, new types of attacks are constantly being created and executed globally. Current rules-based approaches are effective at characterizing and flagging known attacks, but they typically fail when presented with a new attack or new types of data. By comparison, unsupervised machine learning offers distinct advantages by not requiring labeled data to learn from large amounts of network traffic. In this paper, we present a natural language-based technique (suffix trees) as applied to cyber anomaly detection. We illustrate one methodology to generate a language using cyber data features, and our experimental results illustrate positive preliminary results in applying this technique to flow-type data. As an underlying assumption to this work, we make the claim that malicious cyber actors leave observables in the data as they execute their attacks. This work seeks to identify those artifacts and exploit them to identify a wide range of cyber attacks without the need for labeled ground-truth data.
